\section{A Framework of Delay Perception in 3DTI}

%We present a conceptual framework of delay perception in 3DTI. \textbf{In this framework, 3DTI applications are divided into three levels according to their delay requirement. 这句话不清楚，很想知道什么是一个level，但是没有满足预期，猜也猜不到}. Suggestions are given to network engineering for each level. \textbf{Furthermore, we have designed an experiment to illustrate the framework.} Readers can reconstruct the experiment to precisely measure the delay requirement of a specific application.

% The structure of our framework
We present a conceptual framework of delay perception in 3DTI. The framework divides 3DTI tasks into three levels: tasks with \emph{synchronous interaction}, \emph{conversation} and \emph{only visual feedback}. Correspondingly, the three levels of tasks call for high, middle and low requirement of network delay. For each level, the framework also gives suggestions to improve the perceived quality of network.

The framework is supported a comprehensive reviews of previous works. Delay perception is a well-understood research question in audiovisual DIME. \textbf{Our framework partly relies on previous theories and study results（这句话不清楚）}. However, there is a large difference of delay perception between 3DTI and audiovisual DIME. Thus, we take the features of 3DTI into account in order to form our framework.

Noticeability and tolerance of delay are two important factors that were measured by most studies \cite{wu2009quality, schmitt2014influence, geerts2011we, schmitt2014asymmetric}. Some studies also focus on users' perception of overall network quality. These metrics are users' subjective rating in a specific task, and with a specific delay. In our study, we assess subjective feedback via questionnaires similar to \cite{schmitt2014influence}. The questionnaire is on a 5-point Likert scale (Table \ref{tab:table_questionnaire}).

\begin{table} [!htbp]
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.25\columnwidth}|p{0.35\columnwidth}|p{0.3\columnwidth}|}
\hline 
Label & Question & Scale \\
\hline
quality & How do you feel during the experiment? &Bad <--> Excellent \\
\hline
noticeability & Can you perceive the delay in the connection? & Very much <--> Not at all \\
\hline
tolerance & To what extent where you annoyed by the delay? & Severe annoyance <--> No annoyance \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Questions and scale.}
\label{tab:table_questionnaire}
\end{table}

A 3DTI developer may expect a certain recommended delay for his application. However, previous works \cite{montagud2012inter} [?, ?, ?] pointed out that delay perception is largely dependent on user differences and context. Thus, we should investigate the noticeable and tolerable boundary of delay, which is statistically suitable for most users. We first refer to a psychology concept called Just Notice Difference (JND) \cite{xu2013exploiting, sat2009statistical}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{JND}: With other variables fixed, the value for which 50\% of the subjects perceive a difference in their quality.
\end{itemize}

Most related studies recommend using \emph{noticeable delay} and \emph{tolerable delay} as certain values in discussion. We define them as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Noticeable Delay}: the threshold delay that most users can just perceive. In our experiment, we define it as the 50\% JND of zero delays, i.e., more than 50\% of participants score 1 point for noticeability.
    
    \item \emph{Tolerable Delay}: the threshold delay that most users can just tolerant. In our experiment, we define it as the just intolerable delay minus its 50\% JND, i.e., less than 50\% of participants score 4 or 5 points for disruptiveness.
\end{itemize}

We illustrate the relationship between noticeable delay and tolerable delay in figure xxx.

The noticeable delay is very insightful for network engineering. On the one hand, developers should try to improve the network service, to reach the noticeable delay. On the other hand, when a service is already within noticeable delay, we can appropriately increase the delay to have more room for smoothing or recovering packet loss \cite{xu2013exploiting}.

[NOTE] Tolerable delay indicates a boundary that is nearly intolerant. An application can not simply target at it, because it is already a bad service. Instead, the tolerable delay can be used to assess the Quality of Experience (QoE). [?] suggests a linear correlation between end-to-end delay and user experience. We can use noticeable delay and tolerable delay to determine the correlation.

[NOTE from zsyzgu] Here I change my mind about the tolerant delay. Delay can be perceived by cues for sure, however, the tolerance of delay in a specific task may depend on much more factors such as fairness and interactivity \cite{ishibashi2006subjective, montagud2012inter}. So we are not going to model the tolerant delay anymore, but list factors to affect it according to previous work. We will also introduce a way to measure tolerance of a specific delay in a specific task, in our example experiment.

We next introduce the three synchronization levels. The basic idea is the observation that user perceive delay by cues. We determine the level of a task by judging if it contains cues of \emph{synchronous interaction}, \emph{conversation} and \emph{visual feedback} 这个是按照什么来分的？看关键词感觉不到维度. As Table \ref{tab:table_synchronization_levels} shown, we recommend their noticeable delay and tolerable delay by summarizing previous audiovisual works and adapting to the 3D situation （从audiovisual adapt到3D的策略和原则是什么？）.

[NOTE from LZP] In \cite{schmitt2014asymmetric}, the trial only has three delays, 0ms, 500ms and 1000ms. But it has three kinds of delay, symmetric, moderator and random. Meanwhile, paper[64] is similar to this one.
In \cite{tam2012video}, participants rate the conversation on five-point scale items, but the results are all between 3.5 and 4.5. So I pick the biggest delay as the MOS 3.5 delay.
For the rest of examples in conversation section, I can't summarize them. And in \cite{kitawaki1991sub}, the MOS is in the range of 0 to 4, but I think it is the same as 0 to 5.


\subsection{1. Synchronous Interaction}


\subsubsection{synchronous gesture}

If two distributed users have to gesture exactly at the same time, they may be able to perceive delay like checking their own movement. As \cite{nielsen1993response} explained, 100 ms is an upper boundary for users to fell that the system is running instantaneously. For a better performance, a delay of 30 to 50 ms is needed \cite{chen2007review}.

Imaging that a pair is playing rock-paper-scissors in a 3DTI system with a delay of 100 ms. They expect to perform the gesture exactly at the same time. However, at least one player will find that his partner gesture at least 100 ms slower, which may cause annoyance.

\subsubsection{synchronous speaking}

A pair of users would be sensitive to delay if they have to speak at the same time. For example, when counting down together in a 3DTI system with a delay of 100 ms, at least one user will hear repeated sounds more than 100 ms apart. As a reference, the human ear can distinguish an echo from the original direct sound if the delay is more than 100 ms \cite{wolfel2009distant}. Notice that synchronous speaking is different from a conversation (turn talking).

\subsubsection{instrument ensemble}

With the development of the high-quality network, it is clear that networked music performance has a future \cite{carot2007networked}. 3DTI makes these tasks more nature. For example, two distributed musicians can practice piano duet through 3DTI.

A realistic musical interaction assumes a one-way delay of less than 25 ms \cite{carot2007network}. Beyond this threshold, the groove-building-process cannot be realized by musicians. \cite{schuett2002effects} suggests a delay between 10 - 20 ms for providing a stabilizing effect on the tempo. For a relatively worse network, a coping strategy was discovered that allowed the performers to maintain a solid tempo up to 50 - 70 ms of delay.

\subsection{2. Conversation}

Conversation is an important cue for delay perception. In face-to-face situations, we have learned to unconsciously manage a conversation using the timing of the small pauses in speech \cite{sacks1978simplest}.

\subsubsection{Turn-based game}

[NOTE] Most actual networks will not exceed such a large delay \cite{donovan2014understanding} [?, ?]

\subsection{[NOTE] Suggestion for network design}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An application should reach the delay which leads to MOS of 3.5 points.
    \item If already within the noticeable delay, we can appropriately increase the delay to have more room for smoothing and recovering packet loss.
    \item Assistant synchronization can be integrated in an application. For example, we can use synchronized flickers in both side to help a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
\end{enumerate}
