\section{Limitation and FUTURE WORK}

Our work has some limitations. First, the rendering quality of our system is not state-of-the-art. Our pipeline wastes a portion of time in idling. There is still a space to improve the quality while maintaining the high synchronicity. Second, while co-presence has the potential to support eye contact, the head-mounted display gets in the way of eye contact. In the future, it is possible to reconstruct users' eyes by using inward cameras of HMDs. Third, we did not focus on the transmission so far. Efficient compression should be developed to support the 3DTI system in an acutal network.
