\begin{abstract}

We present TeleCP: a software framework for 3D telepresence that adequately supports co-presence. Based on some commercial hardware (Realsense, PCs and HTC Vive), the framework allows distributed users to communicate and interact with each other in the same virtual space at the same time. Co-presence consists of temporal synchronicity and spatial synchronicity. For temporal synchronicity, TeleCP achieves a low end-to-end delay of 50 ms with direct Ethernet connection. TeleCP also provides sync assistance to help the users perform simultaneously regardless of the unavoidable network delay. For spatial synchronicity, we render live 3D reconstruction in Head-Mounted Display (HMD). This approach provides the sense that multiple users share a 3D space. TeleCP further allows users to share props by merging similar physical objects in the two ends. In this paper, we introduce the implementation in details. The open-source project contains an Unity3D plugin that simplifies upper-layer application development. We describe an experiment with two tasks to validate the temporal and spatial synchronicity of TeleCP.

%3D Tele-Immersion (3DTI, e.g., Holoportation \cite{orts2016holoportation}) is the next generation of telecommunication that could become practical in the near future. However, the interaction possibilities of 3DTI have not been well discussed. The cost of developing and deploying a 3DTI system is extremely high. HCI researchers without expertise cannot easily acquire such a system. To fill the gap, we present an open-source, lightweight 3DTI system that supports a high level of co-presence. The system has two advantages. First, it is inexpensive (\$ 7000), easy to deploy and use. Second, according to the brainstorming of possible 3DTI applications, our support of co-presence is the key for new interaction possibilities in 3DTI. The co-presence we supported has four contents: rich visual information, spatial co-presence, high synchronicity, and shared props. In this paper, we introduce the system in details and describe a user study to validate the system.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we demonstrate TeleCP, a software framework for 3D telepresence that adequately supports co-presence. The framework bases on some commercial hardware (Realsense, PCs and HTC Vive, \$7000 in total). It allows a high level of co-presence that distributed users can communicate and interact with each other in the same virtual space at the same time. TeleCP has three new features compared to prior work. First, the one-way end-to-end delay is as low as 50 ms. Second, it provides an optional sync assistance to help the users perform at the same time regardless of the unavoidable network delay. Third, TeleCP to some extent provides shared props. The experiment found that these features improve the user experiences and allow some natural interactions that could only happen in physical communications before.
