### Natural Interaction due to Immersion

Our advanced 3DTI system with reconstruction and rendering in full 3D provides participants with feelings of immersion and co-presence, which leads to natural interaction between the two remote players. 

By observing during the game, it is apparently noticed that most participants show body language to help with communication even during the games where they are permitted to speak to each other(e.g.  leaning forward to attract the partner's attention before speaking; shrugging and spread hands wide to express confusion.)

Interestingly, at the beginning of the game, it is very easy for the participants to fall into confusion of the real and virtual objects. Even having been informed of the virtuality of everything from the other end, some participants still try to move the other's chesses. "I know there is no use in moving the black chesses, but the behavior is just like a kind of instinctive reaction, because, you know, the chesses are just being there, almost physically, which seems to be of no difference with the chess in my hand."

### Extra cues being found

Most participants notice the delay when it is significantly high and several cues are most frequently found. In the Reversi, the expectation of instantly removing the captured chesses is a very important factor in noticing the delay. "Until she removed the captured chesses, I repeated again and again, with my fingers pointing to the target chess. She couldn't have been thinking at that time. That must have been the delay, I bet." In the Rock-Paper-Scissors, the interesting situation as follows is a noticeable cue. "It sounds ridiculous, but it does happen. I feel as if my partner throws rock after seeing I have thrown paper." 

Thanks to full 3D immersion, the participants can play the game under fewer limits but with more freedom instead, which offers chances to find extra cues.(e.g looking at the other from another angle;touching the other's hands or faces while waiting for the other's move.)"I notice that my partner is sort of obsessed with repeatedly reversing the chess in her hand until I place the chess. However, in some turns ,she didn't react instantly, for which the delay should be to blame." Some other cues are dependent on participants' relationship and experience, which should also be taken into account for QoS. "I said the funny word we invented together, and I knew she would have laughed out loud, but she didn't , until after nearly one second and a half."

### More tolerant and less noticeable with audio cues or synchronization assistance

Feelings, about delays, of most participants agree with the randomized delays from the perspective of distribution. Being asked to compare the feelings of respective patterns, most participants show more tolerance and less noticeability with audio cues or synchronization assistance. Analysis of the interviews reveals insights as follows. 

First, verbal interaction diverts attention from the delay. Instead of waiting for participants to take the next step, one can flesh up the interval with frequent talking, of which the delay is less noticeable according to some research[CITE]. 

Second, with frequent communication, the participants are more apt to think of the delay as consideration. It seems that without the help of verbal communication which is more informative and fast, participants are inclined to fed up with the delayed movement of the partner.

Another interesting finding is that synchronization assistance is a practical method in countermeasure to the delay. With the same groups of delays, the group in the game without the synchronization assistance is much less noticed.
